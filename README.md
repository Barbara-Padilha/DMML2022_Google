## Results:
|  | Logistic Regression | KNearestNeighbors | Decision Tree | Random Forest | Neural Networks |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |------------- |------------- |------------- |
| Precision | 0.4444 | 0.4075 | 0 | 0 | 0 |
| Recall  | 0.4458 | 0.3583 | 0 | 0 | 0 |
| F1_Score  | 0.4440 | 0.3230 | 0 | 0 | 0 |
| Accuracy  | 0.4458 | 0.3583 | 0 | 0 | 0 |

With the present results, we can cleary see that BLA BLA Classifier achieved the best values of precision, recall, F1-score and accuracy in the test set created in the notebook used for this project.
This result was expected since blablablabla
